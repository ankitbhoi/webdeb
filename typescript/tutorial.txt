what is typescript?
it is a language built in top of javascript to address the shortcomings of js 

now we know that js is a dynamically typed lang. which means ki whenever we are declaring a variable we do it like :- let number = 10;
later we can update like        number="a";

but issue arises when we need a number in specific as in Math.round(number);    here number should be a int value.

-Typescript is js with type checking

This checking happens at compile time and hence we dont need to individually check every unit of code.

other features are
code completion
refactoring
shorthand notation 
        which are available usually in the editors we use 

talking about the drawbacks:-

compilation always involved - .ts->ts compiler->.js file bcz browsers dont understand ts. This step is called transpilation

for simple projects -> js
for med to large -> ts

let age: number =20;
age = "skit";

this will give an error as age is predefined as a number.
